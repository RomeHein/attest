## Summarize

Attest collects 5 personal informations into the app cache storage:

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
That's why Attest does not use any internet connection. You can use the app in airplane mode.
